		<p class="fold-p">
			There are two inherent problems with seeking designers and developers outside of your founding team as you are most likely working with a tight budget. The first is you'll end up spending more money than you have and potentially get an end result that's not your vision. The second is you'll spend too little and receive a non functioning, terribly designed prototype.
		</p>
		<p class="fold-p">
			Both of these issues pose a major threat to the integrity of your budding venture. Obtaining the ability to develop a functioning web prototype is arguably the first big step towards validating your idea. And the best part is that it's not an impossible task.
